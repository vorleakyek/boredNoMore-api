# BoreNoMore

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript front-end web application for individuals or families looking for fun and exciting activities to do when feeling bored.

## Why I Built This
I want to learn how to fetch data from an API and build a table pattern along with the search and filter functionalities.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Fetch
- API from [https://www.boredapi.com/documentation](https://www.boredapi.com/documentation)

## Live Demo

Try the application live at [https://vorleakyek.github.io/BoredNoMore/](https://vorleakyek.github.io/BoredNoMore/)
Note: It seems that the Bored api website is down, which results in an empty table.

## Features
